    <h2>Fernando Off the Track</h2>
    
    <p>Alonso was born in northern Spain in 1981. His father, an amateur racer himself, had built a racing kart originally for Fernando's sister, Lorena, but she had no interest in racing. Fernando is a known fan of Japanese culture, having a large tattoo of a samurai on his back. Alonso's happiness of McClaren's partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda is also often cited as evidence of his affinity for Japan.</p>
    
    <p>He knows four languages: Spanish, Enlgish, Italian, and French, and he currently resides in Dubai.</p>
